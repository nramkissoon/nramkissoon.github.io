# Japanese Reading DIfficulty Classification for Non-Native Language Learners

For my final project for an advanced CS elective in Natural Language Processing, I elected to 
create a classifying system for Japanese text. Specifically, the system would classify text into
the 5 different [JLPT levels](https://www.jlpt.jp/e/about/levelsummary.html). 
A system like this would be useful for people looking for practice reading materials
that is at their skill level. 

For the design details and performance results of the system, the full paper is linked at the end of this section, but  
implications for future projects stemming from this work will be discussed in this post.

## Future Projects

The classification system is made of several components that handle 
different aspects of feature calculation, text parsing, etc. 
Each of these components can individually be improved upon in future work
and integrated into other software applications. 

Ideas for future work:

1. **Kanji Difficulty Classification** - utilize machine learning techniques with features such as 
unigram frequencies and number of strokes to predict the difficulty of a specific kanji character
2. **Word Difficulty Classification Optimization** - improve and test the word difficulty classifier 
described in the paper with new features and the above-mentioned kanji classifier
3. **Testing Grammatical Regular Expressions** - use example sentences to properly test the regular expressions 
that have been developed to parse for grammatical constructions, improve if necessary
4. **Tag a Large Corpus of Text Using Grammatical Regular Expressions** - use the developed grammatical regular expressions to create a tagged corpus resource
that can be used for language learning applications or research on Japanese grammar
