In order to learn how GraphQL works and practice using Docker, 
I decided to develop this small server project that exposes a GraphQL API
one can use to interact with [MeCab](https://taku910.github.io/mecab/), a morphological
analyzer for the Japanese language. Setting up MeCab on a machine is a pain so Docker is used to install
MeCab and dictionary dependencies in a container for portability to any machine.

## GraphQL API

A single query is implemented that takes in a text argument:
```graphql
query{
  tokenize(text:"大統領") {
    words {
      kanji
      pronunciation
      lexical
      compound1
      compound2
      compound3
      reading
      conjugation
    }
    error {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

The server tokenizes the text and returns data related to each token as specified by the query:
```graphql
{
  "data": {
    "tokenize": {
      "words": [
        {
          "kanji": "大統領",
          "pronunciation": "ダイトーリョー",
          "lexical": "名詞",
          "compound1": "一般",
          "compound2": null,
          "compound3": null,
          "reading": "ダイトウリョウ",
          "conjugation": null
        }
      ],
      "error": null
    }
  }
}
```

Here is where the benefits of GraphQL show up, if a client only needed the readings of the tokens in the text, 
all they have to do is specify that in their query, and they'll only receive the data they requested.

## Implementation Using TypeScript

[TypeGraphQL](https://typegraphql.com/) is used to implement the GraphQL schema and resolvers for the API.
The learning curve is pretty steep as I did not even know annotations existed in TypeScript.
However, being able to define the schema and types in TypeScript makes for a cleaner codebase.

This is a sample type definition that is used in the GraphQL schema:
```typescript
@ObjectType()
export class MecabOutputError {
    @Field(() => String)
    name: string;
    @Field(() => String)
    message: string;
}
```

This simply translates to a type called 'MecabOutputError' that has 2 string fields: name and message.
The fields default to non-nullable.

And here is a resolver:
```typescript
@Resolver()
export class QueryResolver {
    @Query(() => MecabOutput, { nullable: false })
    tokenize(@Arg('text', () => String, { nullable: false }) text: string): MecabOutput {
        return mecabParseSync(text);
    }
}
```

When building a schema with TypeGraphQL, you can choose to emit a .gql schema file which contains the GraphQL translation
of the TypeScript schema you wrote. This is helpful for learning and debugging.

For the above resolver, this is the equivalent GraphQL:
```graphql
type Query {
  tokenize(text: String!): MecabOutput!
}
```

[Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) and Express is used for the actual server. Not much needs to be said here as the two
are easy to set up and integrate together using the [apollo-server-express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apollo-server-express) package.
