From [this GitHub repository on system design](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#system-design-topics-start-here):
```
A service is scalable if it results in increased performance in a manner proportional to resources added.
```

Scalability is a crucial component of system design. Granted, not every system needs to take scalability into consideration.
Most systems like simple webpages can function just fine with only one or a few host servers, for example. 
However in cases such as large companies such as Facebook, Google, and Amazon whose services are used by millions of people 
concurrently and growing, scalability is probably the most important facet of system design. 

The necessity of scalability is easy to understand; going about making a system scalable correctly is 
a complex problem that involves analysis of tradeoffs involving scalability and performance, cost, etc. and 
correct anticipation of the increase in users, data, requests that need to be handled in the future. 

This [Harvard video lecture by David Malan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-W9F__D3oY4) is a good overview of 
general scalability solutions.
Here is a short summary of the covered material:

1. **Vertical Scaling** - upgrading a single machine in order to increase its individual performance, problematic if you need performance **beyond** what the latest technology can offer, also introduces a **single point of failure**
2. **Horizontal Scaling** - using several lower-end machines to handle increased load, lowers individual cost per machine, introduces more **fault tolerance**, requires systems for coordinating several machines (load balancing, routing, etc.), used in **datacenters**
3. **Load Balancing** - **load balancing algorithms** aim to distribute load as evenly as possible
4. **Caching** - storing precalculated responses or files decreases latency and the amount of work needed to serve clients, can cause problems when the cached information becomes outdated
5. **Data Replication** - making copies of data increases redundancy and allows for higher query loads if client requests can be routed/load balanced to different copies of the data
6. **Partitioning** - splitting responsibilities amongst different servers can balance load effectively if implemented correctly

In **Designing Data-Intensive Applications**, Martin Kleppmann explains *how* to discuss scalability. 
When discussing the scalability of a system, **load parameters** need to be succinctly described and understood.
Some examples of load parameters are: 

- requests per second to a web server
- ratio of reads to writes in a database
- hit rate on a cache

Once key load parameters are identified, the effect of increasing the load parameters on performance should be investigated.
For example, if the system load paramter is requests per second to a web server, if requests per second increases by X amount, 
how much does some performance metric (e.g. response time, throughput, etc.) degrade? Furthermore, if requests per second increases by X amount, what resources
can we add to the system to maintain performance?

Regarding performance metrics, like load parameters, need to be properly defined in order to develop a scalability solution. Kleppmann makes a clear case for 
using medians and percentiles rather than averages for describing response times, throughput, and other performance metrics. When looking at response times, 
average response times do not say much about the **typical** response time of a user, the median does. On top of that, businesses generally care about the 99.9% percentile or greater because 
of Service Level Agreements or because at those percentiles, user experience is greatly affected to the point of negatively impacting business.

From here, an important distinction between performance and scalability can be made. Just because a system has high performance now **does not** imply that
it will have high performance when load increases. In the same vein, a scalable system may have poor performance all things considered, but that performance does not degrade 
with increased load because it is scalable.

As a final note, scalability **cannot** be an afterthought when designing systems. It is often harder to turn a non-scalable architecture into a scalable one than it is to
simply scrap the non-scalable architecture and start afresh.
