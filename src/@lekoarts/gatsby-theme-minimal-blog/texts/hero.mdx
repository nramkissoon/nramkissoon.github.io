I'm Nick, and this is my blog for all things related to computer science and software engineering.
This is where I practice my technical written communication skills outside of my professional work.
You'll find design documents and demos of personal projects posted here. In addition,
I share notes and explanations on computer science and engineering topics that I am self-studying such
as Machine Learning and DevOps. My posts are intended to be educational and approachable while also maintaining technical rigor.

Whether you're a recruiter, student, or fellow software engineer, hopefully you'll enjoy and learn something from
my writing :\)
